## Adding Documents to Search Index

There are two primary methods to add documents for searching:

### Method 1: Manual Addition

- Click the "Add manually" button
- Fill in the required document attributes and properties
- Enter the document content
- Save your changes to add the document to the search index

### Method 2: File Upload

- Select the "Upload a file" option
- Choose your document file from your computer
- The system will automatically process and index the file
- Verify that all document properties are correctly extracted

### Document Properties

Each document can have multiple attributes and properties:

- Custom attributes as needed

### Best Practices

- Ensure document content is properly formatted
- Review indexed content to confirm accuracy
