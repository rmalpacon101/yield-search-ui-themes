# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide shows you how to add SearchPro features to your website.

To get started, you'll need to complete these four simple steps:

1. Sign up for SearchPro and create a search collection to store your search data
2. Add your website content to SearchPro
3. Set up your search settings
4. Add the Search UI component to your website

We'll guide you through each step in detail. You can adjust these steps to fit what your website needs.

## **Start Your Search Collection**

Let's set up your first search collection. This is where you'll store and manage all your website's searchable content. The setup process is simple and works the same way for most websites.

### **Sign in to SearchPro**

Visit [app.yieldsearchpro.io](https://app.yieldsearchpro.io). Once there, click "Account icon"  in the top right, and check that you have the right subscription plan.

### **Create a Search Collection**

You'll need to create a collection to store your website's searchable content. This is where all your search data will live. You can add content by typing it in, uploading a file, or using our API.

Creating your first collection is easy - we'll show you how.

When you log in for the first time, you'll see a prompt to create a collection.

1. Look for a box that says "Collection Name" 
2. Enter a name for your collection
3. Click "Create Collection"

Once you're done, you'll see the Browse page. Here you can add your content in two ways: directly typing or pasting JSON data, or uploading a JSON file.

## **Add Your Content**

You can add your website content to SearchPro in three simple ways:

- Type it in directly using our editor - perfect for small updates
- Upload a file with your content - great for adding lots of information at once
- Using our Ingest API - best for websites that update often

Pick the method that works best for you based on how much content you have and how often you need to update it.

### Upload manually

You can add data manually using the built-in editor. Simply type or paste your data in JSON format. This is the best way to add small amounts of data or make quick changes to your search collection.

### Upload a file

Import data by uploading JSON files through the interface - a simple way to bulk upload data.

### Upload using the Ingest API

Use the Ingest API to automatically add data to your search collection. This method is ideal when you:
• Have large amounts of data to upload
• Need automatic data updates
• Want to keep your search data synchronized with your website

The API lets you upload documents individually or in batches. Our documentation includes clear instructions, authentication steps, and code examples to help you begin.

For detailed instructions on using the Ingest API, please refer to our API documentation.
