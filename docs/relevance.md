# Relevance

- [Global Filters](global-filters.md): Configure filters that apply to all search results, regardless of user input. These filters help ensure consistent and relevant results by setting default constraints across the search experience.
- [Ranking and Sorting](sort-ranking.md): Set up how search results are ordered and ranked to show the most relevant items first. You can give higher priority to certain results, adjust how important different factors are, and set a default order for displaying results.
- [Searchable Fields](searchable-fields.md): Define which fields in your data can be searched by users. This allows you to control what content is searchable and how it's matched, ensuring users can find relevant information based on specific data attributes like titles, descriptions, or custom fields.
- [Synonyms](synonyms.md): Create and manage synonym groups to improve search accuracy by connecting related terms. For example, when users search for "laptop," results containing "notebook" or "portable computer" can also be returned, ensuring users find relevant content even when using different terminology.
