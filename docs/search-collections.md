# Search Collections

SearchPro search collection is a container that stores and organizes documents for search functionality. It acts as a database where you can index, query, and manage searchable content. Each collection has its own unique configuration, documents, and search settings.

Key characteristics of a search collection include:

- Dedicated storage space for related documents
- Custom indexing settings for optimal search performance
- Unique API keys for secure access and management
- Ability to perform full-text search across stored documents
- Support for JSON document format

Collections help organize your search data in a structured way, making it easier to manage and query specific sets of information.
